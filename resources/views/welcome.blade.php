                    IISLA is a social enterprise that bridges capital to businesses with the mission to improve and transform the lives of people in remote, rural communities whilst simultaneously protecting the environment, preserving local culture and addressing the needs of the growing population in a sustainable way. Our services enable entrepreneurs to focus on managing operations and growing their businesses whilst creating positive and lasting impact.

                    Our vision is sustainable prosperity for people in rural communities. We believe that if people in remote places live their dreams and aspirations without leaving their homes and families, many of the social and environmental challenges we face today could be avoided, if not eradicated.
                    
                    Our mission is to support the growth of businesses that are solving social and environmental challenges by bridging their access to the right capital and we pledge to reinvest over 50% of our profit to furthering our social mission.
