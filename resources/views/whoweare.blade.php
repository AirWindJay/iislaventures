                <p class="card-text">
                    IISLA embodies the philosophy and story of the founder, a former investment banker and hospitality and tourism management consultant based in London and Manila with particular focus on eco and sustainable developments projects around the world.
                    <br><br>
                    Having witnessed and experienced abject rural poverty as a child, her personal goal is to help bridge the gap between the wealthy and the poor. Raised in a remote farming community in the Philippines and educated in London she collaborates with global, national and local NGOs, government bodies, philanthropists, investors, and large companies to effect positive change where needed.
                    <br><br>
                    She loves travelling and her adventures around the world resulted in her working on a number of projects in remote destinations and got closer to her rural roots. She not only got involved and volunteered in poverty eradication projects of various NGOs, she also invested her own money and built a personal portfolio of impact investments in Europe, Asia and Africa.
                    <br><br>
                    Her experience as a child, coupled with her passion for food and exploring the world, underpins her investment philosophy: she invests in social businesses that not only solve world problems but also ones that touch her heart and connect her to rural destinations: sustainable food production, social and impact tourism, renewable energy, technology and infrastructure, and transport & logistics.
